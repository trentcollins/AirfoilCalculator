# AirfoilCalculator
This repository holds files to calculate inherit properties of different airfoils.

This program accepts National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) wing geometry files and calculates properties for different wings. Given a NACA file, the lift coeffecient, drag coeffecient, and surface area are calculated. Additionally, the lift and drag at STP and standard velocity are calculated. 

Example NACA files are provided, but can be altered to user specifications.
